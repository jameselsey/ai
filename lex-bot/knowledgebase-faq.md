### Can you tell me exact stock levels via the bot?

Yes—tell us:
- what material you’re working with (timber/steel/masonry)

- whether you already own a battery platform

We’ll suggest a few options at different price points.

## Still need help?

If your question isn’t answered here, ask it anyway. If it’s something we can’t help with via the bot, we’ll direct you to a staff member during opening hours.
